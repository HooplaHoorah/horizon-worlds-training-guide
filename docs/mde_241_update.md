# Meta Horizon Worlds Desktop Editor (MDE) v241 – What's New and Updated

The new MDE (v241.0.0.24.299) introduces a refreshed **Creation Home** page and mobile‑focused enhancements. This guide explains the key changes and how to navigate the updated interface.

## Key changes at a glance

- **New Creation Home dashboard** with quick‑start cards and a consolidated navigation sidebar.
- **Mobile innovation call‑outs** highlighting contest categories: *Portrait Mode*, *Social* and *Tap‑to‑Move*.
- A new **My events** (beta) section for scheduling and promoting in‑world events.
- Direct access to **Worlds to remix**, **Templates** and **Documentation**.
- A streamlined **New world** workflow accessible from anywhere in the editor.
- Updated **Getting started** cards that link to guided walkthroughs, community resources and documentation.

## Exploring the Creation Home

The **Creation Home** landing page replaces the old, list‑style world selector. Along the left edge you’ll find:

- **Home** – Returns to the Creation Home dashboard.
- **My worlds** – A list of all worlds you own or have editing access to.
- **My events** *(beta)* – Tools to create and manage events associated with your worlds. Visitors can opt into notifications for scheduled events.
- **Tutorials** – Quick links to official tutorials and learning resources.
- **Worlds to remix** – A curated library of remixable worlds you can use as a starting point.
- **Templates** – Ready‑made template worlds (e.g. game genres, social spaces) you can import and customise.
- **Documentation** – Links to the official documentation site.

A **New world** button sits in the top‑right corner of the dashboard, letting you start a fresh project from anywhere.

Below is the “Getting started” row of cards. Each card focuses on a different entry point:

1. **Start Here** – Launches a guided walkthrough that introduces the MDE UI and basic controls.
2. **Get more visits with events** – Explains how to host events and drive engagement.
3. **Explore resources and forums** – Links to community posts, forums and official guides.
4. **Get started with documentation** – Takes you directly to the official docs.

## Mobile‑first emphasis

The banner at the top of Creation Home promotes the **Meta Horizon Creator Competition: Mobile Innovation** and special categories like *Portrait Mode*, *Social* and *Tap‑to‑Move*. These prompts serve as reminders that worlds should be:

- **Optimised for mobile** – Use simple navigation, low‑complexity geometry and clear text that reads well on a phone screen.
- **Short and replayable** – Aim for 5–8 minute experiences with clear loops, rewards and replay hooks.
- **Portrait friendly** – Consider building scenes that work in portrait orientation. Keep important UI elements within the vertical centre of the screen.
- **Tap‑to‑move** – Provide intuitive tap‑to‑move locomotion or simple teleportation for players on mobile devices.

Even if you’re not entering the competition, following these guidelines will make your worlds more accessible to the rapidly growing mobile audience.

## Creating a new world

To start a new project:

1. From **Creation Home**, click the **New world** button.
2. Choose a template or select a blank world. Templates include pre‑set environments for common genres (e.g. galleries, minigames) and are a great way to jump‑start development.
3. Give your world a name and optional description. This metadata appears in search results and the Horizon Worlds store.
4. Click **Create**. The editor loads and you’re ready to build.

During creation you can:
- Drag and drop assets from the asset library.
- Import templates and remix assets.
- Use generative AI tools (if enabled) to create textures, scripts or audio.
- Test your world in play mode and iterate quickly.

## My events (beta)

The **My events** tab lets you schedule live events in your worlds. An event can be a premiere, fashion show, meetup or any special gathering. From here you can:

- Set a date, start time and duration.
- Add a brief description and thumbnail.
- Publish the event to the Horizon Worlds store so users can opt in to notifications.
- Track RSVPs and visit counts.

Hosting events is a powerful way to increase visits and encourage repeat play sessions.

## Worlds to remix & Templates

- **Worlds to remix** – Choose from popular, remixable worlds. When you remix a world you create a copy of it that you can edit and publish as your own (respecting original creator guidelines).
- **Templates** – These are curated starting points that provide the basic structure for different experiences. For example, a puzzle template might include a pre‑built scoring system and puzzle mechanics.

Remixing and templating accelerate development and ensure your world follows best‑practice patterns.

## Documentation and tutorials

The updated **Documentation** button links out to the official documentation site. There you’ll find:

- Detailed guides on installing and updating the MDE.
- Tutorials for building your first world, adding scripts and using generative AI tools.
- Reference material for the TypeScript API, persistence and advanced features.
- Release notes for each MDE version.

Always consult the documentation when new updates roll out; features can change rapidly.
