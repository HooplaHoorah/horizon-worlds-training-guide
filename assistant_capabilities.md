# Assistant Capabilities and Collaboration Guide

This document summarizes the capabilities and limitations of the ChatGPT assistant for the Meta Horizon Worlds competition and explains how we can collaborate.

## What ChatGPT Can Do

- **Research and documentation**: Search official documentation and trusted sources to find guidelines, tutorials, best practices, and examples. Compile comprehensive guides and keep them up‑to‑date.
- **Planning & design guidance**: Brainstorm world concepts, game mechanics, and genre choices that align with contest rules. Propose how to use GenAI tools such as NPC archetypes, custom models, textures, and audio.
- **TypeScript and script assistance**: Help draft scripts or pseudocode for Horizon Worlds, explain API usage, and troubleshoot code logic using documentation. Provide structure and comments for script files.
- **Asset and generative AI suggestions**: Suggest asset types and craft prompts for generative tools like texture and audio generation. Recommend where to incorporate imported models and generative features.
- **Project management support**: Organize tasks, track progress toward submission deadlines, and manage the GitHub repository. Add or edit files to document work and maintain a repository structure.

## What ChatGPT Cannot Do

- **Run the Horizon Desktop Editor or VR environment**: The assistant cannot install or run the Meta Horizon Worlds Desktop Editor or VR applications. It cannot build or test worlds directly.
- **Interact with in‑world features**: It cannot place objects, adjust properties, preview worlds, or run interactive sessions. A human must perform these tasks in the editor.
- **Access web‑only GenAI tools**: The generative AI tools for Horizon Worlds live inside the Desktop Editor and require user login, so the assistant cannot invoke them directly.
- **Perform live performance testing**: Tasks such as capturing performance metrics or playtesting must be done in the Horizon editor or on a Quest device.

## How We Can Work Together

- **You act as the driver**: You handle all actions inside the Horizon Desktop Editor and VR, including building the world, importing assets, generating AI content, and testing gameplay.
- **ChatGPT acts as navigator and tech lead**: I provide research, planning, script drafting, asset suggestions, and documentation. I will monitor contest requirements and keep our repository up‑to‑date.
- **Prompt crafting and code review**: When you need generative assets, I can help design prompts. When you need scripts, I can draft or review TypeScript code.

By understanding these roles and limitations, we can effectively collaborate to build a world that meets the competition criteria and is ready by the October 31 2025 deadline.
