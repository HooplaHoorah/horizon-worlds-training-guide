# Meta Horizon 2025 Roadmap

Lightweight roadmap for the Mobile Innovation contest (Horizon Worlds) and the Start Developer competition (Quest).

## Phase 0 – Setup

- Confirm Devpost registrations for both contests.
- Verify:
  - Horizon Worlds desktop editor installed and updated.
  - Quest / Link ready for testing.
- Ensure Dropbox and GitHub repo access for all collaborators.

## Phase 1 – Concept Lock

- Brainstorm 3–5 concepts with ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini.
- Choose one concept that:
  - Works as a cozy/social Horizon world.
  - Ports cleanly to Quest with hand tracking + passthrough.
- Save a 1–2 page **Concept Brief** as `contests/concept-brief.md`.

## Phase 2 – Horizon Worlds Build

- Greybox world layout (core areas + navigation).
- Implement core loop and at least one unique cozy/social mechanic.
- Add NPCs using Creator Assistant and GenAI tools.
- Optimize for **portrait mode + tap-to-move** and mobile performance.

## Phase 3 – Quest Build (Start Developer)

- Set up Unity (or other stack) project.
- Implement:
  - Hand-tracking interactions for main actions.
  - Passthrough + AI companion experiment.
- Iterate until interactions feel good in-headset.

## Phase 4 – Submission Assets

For both contests:

- Record <3-minute demo videos (mobile and Quest).
- Capture screenshots.
- Draft and refine written descriptions and bullet-point highlights.
- Run final rule checklist using the Dropbox rules doc.

## Phase 5 – Daily Logs (optional but recommended)

Create files in `contests/daily-logs/` named like `YYYY-MM-DD.md` with sections:

```markdown
# Daily Log – YYYY-MM-DD

## What we did
- ...

## Decisions
- ...

## Blockers / questions
- ...
```

These logs keep ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, and human collaborators aligned.
